    "We have two learning tasks that involve the same _kind_ of input data, but don't have exactly aligned samples. In each of the learning tasks we have different numbers of i.i.d. samples, but we don't have overlapping sets necessarily in terms of our input data. One other assumption we have baked into this model is that the weights, while given a set for each task, are shared from a parental prior, hence there is parameter sharing amongst the learning tasks, though not in our usual \"classical\" sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "By appending zero-padding, we should be able to generalize this to multi-task neural network learning with non-overlapping samples. [Thomas Wiecki](https://twiecki.io/blog/2018/08/13/hierarchical_bayesian_neural_network/) has a great blog post on how to do it, though he didn't deal with the \"number of samples\" issue, which I tried to add here."
