    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In some datasets, we have truncated or qualified values. These may arise because of a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One might be that the measurement device has an upper- or lower-bound limit of detection\n",
    "2. Another might be because of protocol reasons, such as not subjecting an animal to a condition beyond a pre-defined \"ethical\" limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in data for which a subset of values are real-valued, but the complementary set of values are imputed as the upper-bound or lower-bound value. \n",
    "\n",
    "For machine learning purposes, how do we deal with these bounds? One approach might be to approach it as a two-stage ML problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the first stage, predict whether the value is beyond our bounds or not.\n",
    "2. In the second stage, predict the actual value for those real-valued measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this means we lose the rich information stored in real-valued numbers. Perhaps there could be another way of approaching the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Qualified Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I want to explore what imputation of qualified values would look like. In particular, I am choosing a parametric strategy, in which I impose a prior distribution on the data, optimize the parameters of the distribution to best fit the data, and finally draw numbers from that distribution to impute such that we remain in a regression setting."
