    "\"If you use Bayesian methods, there should be nothing stopping you from doing comparisons of more than two groups.\" With this pedagogical article, I hope to make the case that mastering a language that allows us to construct arbitrary models enables us to go beyond simple case/control (A/B) testing, giving us a tool to flexibly analyze data originating from complex experimental designs. \n",

    "## Introduction\n",

    "### Observations on A/B Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian A/B testing has been gaining popularity over the years. I believe that there are two conceptual and two practical reasons for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conceptual Reasons\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, A/B tests are conceptually simple. I have a baseline (group \"A\"), and compare it to a perturbed setting (group \"B\"), and do an analysis comparing some summary statistic of both groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, established methods exist for doing A/B analyses, the most common being the t-test. Under certain assumptions, say, equal variance, with a t-distributed likelihood function, having carefully determined the degrees of freedom... At the risk of revealing a spoiler of this article, how often do we actually encounter these assumptions? Can we go further and do A/B\\[/C/D/E\\] testing? What about breaking these rigid assumptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Reasons\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we have probabilistic programming languages that allow us to express the classical t-test in a Bayesian fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we have a wealth of freely available teaching material online, enabling a new generation of data scientists to conduct Bayesian A/B tests.\n"

    "### On Probabilistic Programming Languages (PPLs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first practical reason touched on PPLs. PPLs, such as PyMC3 (#cite), Stan (#cite) and Edward (#cite), allow us to express a statistical model in terms of (a) probability distributions describing our beliefs about a particular parameter, essentially assigning \"credibility points\" to parameter values and/or ranges, and (b) mathematical functions (a.k.a. transformations) that link what statisticians call \"independent\" or \"predictor\" variables to one or more \"target(s)\" or \"output(s)\". (#diagram) \n",
    "\n",
    "By use of simulation methods (essentially Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling), PPLs provide a level of abstraction away from the difficult mathematics underlying Bayesian statistical inference. Without PPLs, Bayesian statistical analysis would often involve intractable integrals; without PPLs, in order to make these integrals tractable, we would usually have to limit ourselves to models that take advantage of distribution conjugacy, such as the Beta-Bernoulli/Binomial model, or assume Gaussian-distributed parameters and likelihoods."

    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is the generalization of the Normal and Cauchy distributions, and hence is a flexible distribution for modelling purposes. Here, we assumed that our data were t-distributed. However, even this assumption can be changed for a different distribution, with different parameters, and hence different priors placed on those parameters. For example, if our measured variable were count data, then we could change the distribution to a discrete one, such as the poisson or negative binomial, or even zero-inflated versions of them.\n",

    "While not discussed here, hierarchical models are very easy to implement in PyMC3. Using the example in this notebook, the major change is that instead of specifying a single number for the `mu` and `sd` parameters across all groups, we specify a probability distribution that it is drawn from, with its own \"hyper-parameters\".
