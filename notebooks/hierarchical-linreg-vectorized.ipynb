    "We have two learning tasks that involve the same _kind_ of input data, but don't have exactly aligned samples. In the first learning task, we have 100 iid samples; in the 2nd learning task we have 80 iid samples. In our data matrix, the 2nd task's 80 iid samples are not necessarily aligned with the 100 iid samples from the 1st task. One other assumption we have baked into this model is that the weights, while given a set for each task, are shared from a parental prior, hence there is parameter sharing amongst the learning tasks, though not in our usual \"classical\" sense.\n",
